Project 2: Secure File Store
===============================================


If you have questions about or find errors in this documentation, please post on
Piazza.

For this project, you can work in teams of up to 2 people.

All of your code must go in `client.py`.

You must use Python 3 and PyCrypto 2.6.1 (or later) for this project. These are
already provided for you on Hive and most other instructional machines. Double
check that you are using Python3---on many machines (including Hive), the
`python` command defaults to Python 2. Use the `python3` command. For more
details see the `Getting Started` section in the online documentation.


Note: Uploading and downloading using pycrypto, share and revoke part on school class account which has expired :(
